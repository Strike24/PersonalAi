<br> It understands text or voice commands and uses function calling to run specialized actions on your PC.

## Features

## Technical Explanation
Actions are defined as functions inside a module, with each function corresponding to a specific command or task. The assistant uses these functions and decides when to call them based on user input and context.

The **modular design** allows for easy updates 🔁 and the addition of new features ✨ without disrupting existing functionality.
